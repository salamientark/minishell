How does minishell work step by step:

=== PROMPT ===
= - Minishell wait for user input finished by '\n'
===	===

- Minisehll first split input into input_tab if there is multiple '\n'
	(After a copy paste for exemple)
	It will go to error if ther is a global unclosed quote/backet/parnthesis
	If success input is splitted by unquote/unbrace/unparnthesed '\n'
	And treated separatly
		See: src/lexer/split_input.c

- Foreach input in the input_tab minishell wil launch interpreter
	Which consist of Lexer->Parser->Expander->Redirection->Execution

=== LEXER ===
