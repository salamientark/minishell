- Here_doc document should be opened during parsing in parent process
- Quoting should be expended and executed after parsing ?
- IF A builtin function is used without pipes, it isn't forked


- Only one infile and one outfile maxiumum (redirection)
- but when multiple redirection occurs you have to open the file and closethem
- Only the last infile and last outfile are used 

- If there is only one redirection of type (/dev/stdin || /dev/stdout) ?

PARSING
1 quote error

3 syntax error (pipe should have alphanumerical char the left && redirection need alphanumchar at the right)



4 EXPAND ?
qt the end

NO file outfile

ls > outfile < outfile    <=== Is ok file is created, only ls is redirected to file
